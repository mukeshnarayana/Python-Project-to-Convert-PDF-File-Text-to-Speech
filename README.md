TEXT-to-SPEECH enables the real-time transcription of TEXT streams into AUDIO in more than 90 languages . 
TEXT-to-SPEECH service can be tailored to your voice or vocabulary to build custom recognition models, further enhancing accuracy. 
In addition to the standard TEXT-to-SPEECH service, you can also create custom  language, and pronunciation models. 
Further, batch transcription is possible for longer audio or a large number of files.
